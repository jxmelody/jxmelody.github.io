	abstract = {Although long-read sequencing enables the generation of complete genomes for unculturable microbes, its high cost limits the widespread adoption of long-read sequencing in large-scale metagenomic studies. An alternative method is to assemble short-reads with long-range connectivity, which can be a cost-effective way to generate high-quality microbial genomes. Here, we develop Pangaea, a bioinformatic approach designed to enhance metagenome assembly using short-reads with long-range connectivity. Pangaea leverages connectivity derived from physical barcodes of linked-reads or virtual barcodes by aligning short-reads to long-reads. Pangaea utilizes a deep learning-based read binning algorithm to assemble co-barcoded reads exhibiting similar sequence contexts and abundances, thereby improving the assembly of high- and medium-abundance microbial genomes. Pangaea also leverages a multi-thresholding algorithm strategy to refine assembly for low-abundance microbes. We benchmark Pangaea on linked-reads and a combination of short- and long-reads from simulation data, mock communities and human gut metagenomes. Pangaea achieves significantly higher contig continuity as well as more near-complete metagenome-assembled genomes (NCMAGs) than the existing assemblers. Pangaea also generates three complete and circular NCMAGs on the human gut microbiomes.},

	title = {{ifDEEPre}: large protein language-based deep learning enables interpretable and fast predictions of enzyme commission numbers},
	abstract = {Accurate understanding on the biological functions of enzymes is vital for various tasks in both pathologies and industrial biotechnology. However, existing methods are usually not fast enough and lack explanations on the prediction results, which severely limits their real-world applications. Following our previous work, DEEPre, we propose a new interpretable and fast version (ifDEEPre) by designing novel self-guided attention and incorporating biological knowledge learned via large protein language models to accurately predict the commission numbers of enzymes and confirm their functions. Novel self-guided attention is designed to optimize the unique contributions of representations, automatically detecting key protein motifs to provide meaningful interpretations. Representations learned from raw protein sequences are strictly screened to improve the running speed of the framework, 50 times faster than DEEPre while requiring 12.89 times smaller storage space. Large language modules are incorporated to learn physical properties from hundreds of millions of proteins, extending biological knowledge of the whole network. Extensive experiments indicate that ifDEEPre outperforms all the current methods, achieving more than 14.22\% larger F1-score on the NEW dataset. Furthermore, trained ifDEEPre models accurately capture multi-level protein biological patterns and infer evolutionary trends of enzymes by taking only raw sequences without label information. Meanwhile, ifDEEPre predicts the evolutionary relationships between different yeast sub-species, which are highly consistent with the ground truth. Case studies indicate that ifDEEPre can detect key amino acid motifs, which have important implications for designing novel enzymes. A web server running ifDEEPre is available at https://proj.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/aihlab/ifdeepre/ to provide convenient services to the public. Meanwhile, ifDEEPre is freely available on GitHub at https://github.com/FarseekerTAN/ifDEEPre/.},

	abstract = {Linked-read sequencing technologies generate high-base quality short reads that contain extrapolative information on long-range DNA connectedness. These advantages of linked-read technologies are well known and have been demonstrated in many human genomic and metagenomic studies. However, existing linked-read analysis pipelines (e.g., Long Ranger) were primarily developed to process sequencing data from the human genome and are not suited for analyzing metagenomic sequencing data. Moreover, linked-read analysis pipelines are typically limited to 1 specific sequencing platform.To address these limitations, we present the Linked-Read ToolKit (LRTK), a unified and versatile toolkit for platform agnostic processing of linked-read sequencing data from both human genome and metagenome. LRTK provides functions to perform linked-read simulation, barcode sequencing error correction, barcode-aware read alignment and metagenome assembly, reconstruction of long DNA fragments, taxonomic classification and quantification, and barcode-assisted genomic variant calling and phasing. LRTK has the ability to process multiple samples automatically and provides users with the option to generate reproducible reports during processing of raw sequencing data and at multiple checkpoints throughout downstream analysis. We applied LRTK on linked reads from simulation, mock community, and real datasets for both human genome and metagenome. We showcased LRTKâ€™s ability to generate comparative performance results from preceding benchmark studies and to report these results in publication-ready HTML document plots.LRTK provides comprehensive and flexible modules along with an easy-to-use Python-based workflow for processing linked-read sequencing datasets, thereby filling the current gap in the field caused by platform-centric genome-specific linked-read data analysis tools.},
